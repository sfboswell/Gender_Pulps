# Network Analysis of Gender in Publication  

This code uses R to analyze (gendered) patterns in publication, primarily through networks. It relies on tsv files of bibliographic material. The code could be used to investigate almost any publication pattern, depending both on the user's interests, and the information within the bibliographic files.
